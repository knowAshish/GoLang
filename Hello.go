package main // This defines the package name. 'main' is special â€” it tells Go that this is an executable program.

import "fmt" // The 'fmt' package provides I/O formatting functions like Println.

func main() { // The main function is the entry point of a Go program. Execution starts here.

	fmt.Println("Hello! This is Go") // This prints the string to the console followed by a new line.
